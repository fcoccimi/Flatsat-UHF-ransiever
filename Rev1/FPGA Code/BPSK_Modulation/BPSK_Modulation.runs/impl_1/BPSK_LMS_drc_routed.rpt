2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[4]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[5]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[6]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[6]_i_2/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[6]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net UART_RX/outd_reg[7]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin UART_RX/outd_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell UART_RX/outd_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
